    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Answer :-\n",
    "Database :\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL :-\n",
    "1. Database are categorized as Relational Database Management System(RDBMS).\n",
    "2. SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined scheme.\n",
    "3. SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.\n",
    "4. SQL databases are vertically scalable.\n",
    "5. SQL databases use a powerful language \"Structured Query Language\" to define and manipulate the data.\n",
    "6. SQL databases are best suited for complex query.\n",
    "8. MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database.\n",

    "NoSQL :-\n",
    "1. NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system.\n",
    "2. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.\n",
    "3. NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.\n",
    "4. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "5. In NoSQL databases, collection of documents are used to query the data. It is also called unstructured query language. \n",
    "   It varies from database to database.\n",
    "6. NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.\n",
    "7. NoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "8. MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database\n"
